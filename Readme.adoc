= HasResult
Fran√ßois Lamboley <fload@me.com>

A simple protocol package that does nothing.
The `HasResult` protocol has a simple `result` property and a `ResultType` associated type.
This is mostly useful for `Operation` (the operation has a result type which can be retrieved when the operation is done).
