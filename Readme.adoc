= HasResult
François Lamboley <fload@me.com>

A simple protocol package that does nothing.
The `HasResult` protocol has a simple `result` property and a `ResultType` associated type.
This is mostly useful for `Operation` (the operation has a result type which can be retrieved when the operation is done).

This whole library fits in these lines:
[source,swift]
----
public protocol HasResult {
   
   associatedtype ResultType
   var result: Result<ResultType, Error> {get}
   
}
----

This protocol is easy to create in one’s project, but it can be useful to share and reuse a common protocol.
